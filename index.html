<TD ALIGN="LEFT"><p>Hello and welcome to my website. My name is Card, and for the better part of seven years now I've been formally studying history and sociology, becoming increasingly passionate about anarchist and militantly anti-fascist organising, and conspicuously introducing myself by my last name.</p>


<p>Nowadays, I balance my interests and commitments by working as a full-time researcher half the year, while also doing as much as I can to grow and support non-hierarchical forms of community support and defence - particularly mutual aid groups and tenants' unions. In what little free time I manage to eke out, I also write intermittently for a number of publications, and always have at least a handful of big creative projects on the go somewhere.</p>       

<p>I made this website so I could collate all my work in one place and explain what it is I do, especially since more of my writing and some of my recent forays into video content are starting to reach a wider audience. Whether you found me through my political work, my writing, the content I've recently been putting on YouTube, or by any other means - if you've enjoyed or appreciated a project of mine, I want to make it as easy as possible for you to see all the other things I've worked on too.</p> 

<p>If you're also a progressive organiser or activist, or some sort of creative type with left-wing sympathies, I'm always interested in working together with others on all sorts of projects - so, please feel free to get in touch, introduce yourself, and let me know if you've got something you'd like to collaborate on.</p>

I'm working on making it more easily viewable on a phone but it's not a huge priority. • Next immediate projects: YouTube videos, adding more items to the Projects Archive page - all time dependent
