<td align="LEFT"><i>People Mover</i> began as a series of vignettes about a girl traveling across the US-Canadian border I did as fiction-writing practice in 2019. I later polished it up into a short novella, threw together a cover design, and hawked it around indie literature circles here in Australia as something of a passion project for a bit.  

<p>

Nowadays, I mainly just keep People Mover in my back pocket as a little novelty, but I've never fully abandoned the idea of coming back to the story at some point or adapting it into another creative work. I've tinkered with the story a little bit since, and have already adapted it into a three-hour audiobook. Eventually, I'd like to explore the possibility of adapting it into a stageplay or a short film too.

<p>

It's really convenient to have a piece of fiction that's entirely my own to be able to use as the basis for creative experimentation like that. You won't find <i>People Mover</i> on bookstore shelves, but, for what it's worth, here I present some of my early work.
