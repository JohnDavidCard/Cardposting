<p style="text-align:left">
People Mover began, around mid-2019, as a series of short, unconnected, vignettes set among the truckstops and way stations of the US-Canadian border. It was initially just an personal exercise in writing prose. I had been writing journalistic non-fiction regularly for around two years by that point, but for all the interesting ideas for stories I was holding onto, I had never found creative writing to come to me anywhere near as easily.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:left">
Writing out these little scenes - and other little practice pieces - did start to leave me feeling a bit more confidant about what I was doing, however. Before too long, my desire to see more done with the setting lead me to think about how the little vignettes could be thematically tied together, and I reworked what I had into one cohesive roadtrip story.</p>  

<p style="text-align:left">
Wanting feedback for what I had put together, I started sharing chapters of the story one-at-a-time to the small following of people I'd largely met just through a couple years of networking in creative spaces. By and large, other people seemed to like it, so by early-2020, I decided to give the whole thing a cursory going-over to weed out any previously overlooked typos and such, and re-wrote a handful of paragraphs here and there that sounded a little too awkward, compiled it all into a .pdf alongside some original artwork for the cover and title page and considered it a finished novella. 

<p style="text-align:left">
I ended up having it available on Amazon as a print-on-demand paperback for the rest of the year, and between supportive friends, people who had been following me for my prior writing, and others who heard about the book through the first two groups, it astonishingly ended up selling a few hundred copies. People Mover was the flavour of the month on quite a few underground independent book sites and forums and the like for a while, and it only took the occasional good review here and there to keep the word of mouth buzz going.          

<p style="text-align:left">
Seeing how many people were getting into it, I made a digital version of the book freely available in as many places as I could, because I wanted anyone who was interested to be able to read it if they so wished. A year on, I was amazed at how well it had been received by so many, and I'll always cherish all the heartfelt comments and messages from people letting me know how much they story and characters.   

<p style="text-align:left">
By the end of the year, the book had picked up something of a small following - and, to my surprise, my name even started to occasionally precede me in online indie literary circles from time to time. What wasn't as good - I saw on more than one occasion that malignant online trolls and an iamgeboard denizens would also pop up from time to time to imitate me or anonymously trash the book, but nothing that happens like that on the web is too hard for anyone with their head properly screwed onto their shoulders to just shrug off if it happens.  

<p style="text-align:left">
I ended up re-reading People Mover myself for the first time in a while at the start of 2021 while pondering what I might want to do with it going forward, and I ended up deciding not to do much more for the time being than to just give it a bit of a re-format, re-do the cover art, and just keep a .pdf of it on hand to send to anyone who really wanted it. I did decide to pull the paperback version from Amazon though, partially because I've since soured a bit on the idea of taking money for creative works, and it really isn't the most ethical company to implicitly support by using in any case.

<p style="text-align:left">
At the moment, People Mover is still the project I see most associated with my name, and mentions of it and me do continue to pop up in some of the most surprising places. Looking back on it now, I think I feel about it the way most creatives feel about anything I've made once they've moved onto subsequent projects: proud of it and the fact I did it, but critical of it in several respects, looking back.  

<p style="text-align:left">
The book makes a few stylistic choices I wouldn't be likely to repeat if I re-did the whole thing again - like a fairly frequent use of gratuitous italics for emphasis, and there's a few sections that definitely come off a bit purple prose-y. But on the whole, I still like the overall concept as well as the narrative arc the central character follows. Plus, I hold firm to the proviso that an awareness of the flaws in one's older work just means you've improved in the medium since then. 

<p style="text-align:left">
Although I still much prefer non-fiction and opinion piece stuff - which I do under a few different names and banners these days - I would like to return to relatively longer-form fiction at some point. As for People Mover - I'm glad so many people ended up enjoying it, and I'm thankful for how many more pairs of eyes it also drew to my other projects, but continuous pursuit of artistic expression in any form requires that eventually you put older projects aside and move onto the next thing when you're ready. 

<p style="text-align:left">
I might come back to People Mover eventually, and that could mean anything from a page-one rewrite to improve the prose while keeping the central premise, to attempting to adapt the novella into a short film or stageplay script, or something else entirely - but I have no plans for it in the immediate future.
